      "Colachel is a historic port town that overlooked the Arabian Sea and was visited by Vasco da Gama in the 15th century. It was part of the Travancore State prior to 1956 when its borders were readjusted. After the defeat of the Dutch by King Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma in 1741, a victory pillar had been erected near the beach in commemoration of the victory. The town is bounded on the south by Arabian Sea.Its western boundary is encompassed by Pampoori Vaikal. Nagercoil, which is the administrative center of Kanniyakumari District, lies 20 km towards the north-east of this town."
