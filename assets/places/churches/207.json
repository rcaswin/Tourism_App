The church was dedicated to St. Catherine of Alexandria and was constructed by English missionaries. Unfortunately, towards the end of the 19th century, this village experienced a devastating flood that caused great destruction.The name of the new settlement was bestowed by its residents - Puthenthurai, derived from two words meaning 'new' and 'coastal village'. This place henceforth became known as Santa Catherina Puthenthurai (St catherineputhenthurai)."],
