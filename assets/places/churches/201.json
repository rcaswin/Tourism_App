    "description": ["Muttom's All Saints Church stands out as one of the most iconic places of worship in the area. The place has gained huge popularity with nearly 800 supporters, along with a well-known tourist destination. This congregation stands on the scenic coast of the Bay of Bengal, bordered by mesmerizing blue waters. This conclave has been set up perfectly, framed by water & roads. It is a catholic church and has innate Portuguese principle amid the period 1875-1914. The Portuguese artistry is showcased through the impressive external aesthetics and the simplistic yet extraordinary interiors of their buildings. It's a brilliant example of architectural finesse that is difficult to match."],
