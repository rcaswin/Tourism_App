      "description": ["Udayagiri Fort is one of the most prominent tourist stopovers in the city. Also known as De Lannoy’s Fort or Dillani Kottai, it is a remnant of the regime of Travancore. The fort is surrounded by an isolated hill about 260 high and was used as a training ground for the king’s army. Remains of the furnace used for making ammunition stand as a testimony to the fact. Interestingly, it is said that a brass gun, 16-ft-long, was found in the fort complex but could not be moved even a few feet by a number of people including 16 elephants. Now, the fort has been turned into a natural park and one can find a tree house, herbal gardens, bird and deer enclosures and an aquarium."],
