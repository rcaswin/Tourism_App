      "Thengapattinam stands out amongst other cities as it was one of the first places in India that embraced Islam during the era of Prophet Muhammad. This is a unique and special distinction that Thengapattinam holds. Islam got firmly rooted here due to the peaceful propagation of the great spiritual leader Malik ibn Deenar (rah) who came from Arabia in the 7th century through Kodungalur in Kerala.His Arabic team built a big mosque here made of hard rocks which is known here as ‘valiapalli’. According to the ancient Arabic reference book ‘Rihlathul Muluk’, there was a hub here of religious activity, which was headed by Syed Ubaithath Kazhi' – the religious propaganda secretary of the district. Many Islamic scholars came over time to this location for proselytizing purposes."
