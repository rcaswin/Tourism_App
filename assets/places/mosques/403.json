    "name": "Malik Deenar Juma Mosque Valiya Palli",
    "description": [
      "One of the earliest mosques to be ever constructed in India, built by Malik ibn Deenar (after whom the mosque is named) â€” an accomplice of Prophet Muhammad , 1400 years ago. The Valiya Palli Mosque has been through years of political uprising yet still stands tall and proud. Its brickwork, spanning different eras of culture, can now be seen in all its grandeur inside a modern structure that exudes a Neo-Arabian influence. The mosque sports an anchronistic vibe surrounding it, expedited by the antique structure, and the obsession with history, and pride."
