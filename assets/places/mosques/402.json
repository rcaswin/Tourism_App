      "Mosques are a crucial part of the Islamic faith and they serve as places of prayer. Typically, they are an enclosed space, but even outdoor courtyards can be used for worshipping. From the very start, mosques have been utilized as a place of prayer and contemplation for Muslims. Initially, they may not have built structures like today, but rather open spaces that provided an atmosphere of worship."
