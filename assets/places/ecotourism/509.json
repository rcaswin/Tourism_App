      "Perunchani Dam is located about 62 kilometers away from Kanniyakumari. Perunchani Dam is an irrigation dam  in Kalkulam Taluk, Kanniyakumari district, in the state of TamilNadu, India. It is one of the dams of the Kodayar Irrigation System. As there was water deficiency in the Kodayar Irrigation System, Perunchani Dam was constructed in December 1952 to store flood water of the Paralayar River as an extension. It was built about 1 km (0.62 mi) upstream of the Puthen dam on the Paralayar River. The irrigation system became operational on 2 September 1953. It feeds the left bank irrigation canal system of the Puthen dam, which is the terminal structure of the system."
