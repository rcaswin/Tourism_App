      "Kalikesam is located about 35 kilometers away from kanniyakumari.  Kalikesam is unique in that it is a conjuction of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem â€“ the shola forest where the trees are evergreen, the main forest and the marshy swamos. Within the depths of this lush and bountiful landscape, it is evident that we are in awe of the abundance of God's blessings.The peace and calmness of the forest makes the views astonished. As we venture further into Kalikesam Falls, the atmosphere becomes thicker and more oppressive. The whole breeze acts as a balm while the bubbling sound of national springs is a music to the ears. The place gets plenty of rainfall and enjoys pleasent weather round the year."
