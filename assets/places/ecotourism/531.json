    "description": ["Valli Chunai Is a Beautiful Small Waterfalls Located in Kumaracovil Near Nagercoil.Valli Chunai waterfalls Located at the top of the Hill and you need to trek almost 1 hour to reach this place, there is no proper path but you could find many directions in the rock and stones inside the forest which guide you to reach this place. Once, you find this waterfall at top of the hill you won’t believe the mother nature’s beauty, the horror voice of waterfalls inside the cave and the environment gives a different vibe, but I don’t think this place is more suitable for a family trip plan but I think this would be a heaven for adventure seekers, nature lovers and the people who love to trek. The view what you see from the top of the hill is amazing, and you won’t believe it. After sunrise and before sunset it’s a good time to trek, but make sure to have a plan during a monsoon or after monsoon but summer is not a good time to visit because inside the waterfalls water will be less"],
